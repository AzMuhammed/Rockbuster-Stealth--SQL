# Key Questions and Objectives


The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:


● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
